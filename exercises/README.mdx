# React Hooks 🎣

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-hooks/react-hooks-intro" />

👨‍💼 Hello! I'm Peter the Product manager and I'm here to help guide you through
this workshop. I'll be there to tell you what our users want and to help you
understand the requirements of the tasks you'll be working on.

React hooks are a critical part of React development. You can think of them as
atoms to the React component molecule. Everything outside of basic rendering
can be done with hooks.

In this workshop, we'll learn how to use hooks to manage state, synchronize
side-effects, generate unique ids, and more. There's a lot to hooks and we'll
get into more advanced use cases in a future workshop. In this one you'll get
a solid understanding of the basic hooks and how to use them.

So let's get started!
