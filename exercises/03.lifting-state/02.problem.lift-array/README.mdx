# Lift More State

👨‍💼 The users loved 🧝‍♂️ Kellie's like feature so much they want to have the blog
posts sorted by whether they're favorites.

🧝‍♂️ I've already created the sort function. Now you need to add the logic to sort
them based on whether they're favorited. And that means you need to lift some
state...

👨‍💼 Yep. We're going to need you to lift the favorited state from the cards to
the `MatchingPost` component. We'll also need to restructure it slightly as
well. Don't worry. The emoji will guide you. Good luck!
