# Colocate State

üë®‚Äçüíº Well, the users thought they wanted the articles sorted by whether they were
favorited... But after using the feature, they found it to be jarring and
confusing. So we're going to need you to remove that feature. Kellie already
removed the sorting for you, but she didn't have time to move the state back to
the `Card` component.

As a community we're pretty good at lifting state. It becomes natural over time.
In fact it's required to make the feature work. But as you notice here, the
functionality we want is already "working" without moving any of the state
around so it's easy to forget to improve the performance and maintainability of
our code by moving state back down (or
[colocate state](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/state-colocation-will-make-your-react-app-faster)).

So your job is to move the `favorited` state back to the `Card` component.

When you're finished, the functionality should be no different, but the code
should feel simpler.
