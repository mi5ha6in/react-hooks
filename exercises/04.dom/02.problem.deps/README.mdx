üë®‚Äçüíº Our users wanted to be able to control `vanilla-tilt` a bit. Some of them
like the speed and glare to look different. So Kellie üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è added a form that will
allow them to control those values. This is working great, but something we
noticed is the tilt effect is getting reset whenever you click the count button!

ü¶â The reason this happens is because the ref callback is called every time the
component is rendered (and the cleanup runs between renders). So we're
re-initializing the tilt effect on every render.

üë®‚Äçüíº This is inefficient and it's a jarring experience if the user clicks on the
corner of the count button. We want the effect to only re-initialize when the
options change.

The trick is we want the effect to re-initialize when the `vanillaTiltOptions`
change, but nothing else. So we can use `useEffect` to do that:

```tsx
useEffect(
	() => {
		// set up stuff
		return function cleanup() {
			// clean up stuff
		}
	},
	// depend on stuff:
	[],
)
```

ü¶â React needs to know when it needs to run your effect callback function again.
We do this using the dependency array which is the second argument to
`useEffect`. Whenever values in that array changes, React will call the returned
cleanup function and then invoke the effect callback again.

By default, if you don't provide a second argument, `useEffect` runs after every
render (similar to what we're currently experiencing with the `ref` callback).
While this is probably the right default for correctness, it's far from optimal
in most `useEffect` cases. If you're not careful, it's easy to end up with
infinite loops (imagine if you're calling `setState` in the effect which
triggers another render, which calls the effect, which calls `setState` and so
on).

üë®‚Äçüíº So what we need to do in this step is move our `ref` callback stuff to
`useEffect`, create a `useRef` so we can access the DOM node in the `useEffect`
callback, and let React know that our effect callback depends on the
`vanillaTiltOptions` the user is providing. Let's do that by passing the
`vanillaTiltOptions` in the dependency array.

	You'll notice an issue when you've finished this step. If you click the button
	to increment the count, the tilt effect is still reset! We'll fix this in the
	next step.
