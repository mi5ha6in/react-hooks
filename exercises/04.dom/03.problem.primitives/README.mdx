# Primitive Dependencies

<EpicVideo url="https://www.epicreact.dev/workshops/react-hooks/primitive-dependencies" />

üë®‚Äçüíº Our users are annoyed. Whenever they click the incrementing button in the
middle, the tilt effect is reset. You can reproduce this more easily by clicking
one of the corners of the button.

Moving things into a `useEffect` was supposed to help this because we can be
explicit about which dependencies trigger the `cleanup` and effect to be run
again. But we're still having the problem.

If you add a `console.log` to the `useEffect`, you'll notice that it runs even
when the button is clicked, even if the actual options are unchanged. The reason
is because the `options` object actually _did_ change! This is because the
`options` object is a new object every time the component renders. This is
because of the way we're using the `...` spread operator to collect the options
into a single (brand new) object. This means that the dependency array will
always be different and the effect will always run!

`useEffect` iterates through each of our dependencies and checks whether they
have changed and it uses `Object.is` to do so (this is effectively the same
as `===`). This means that even if two objects have the same properties, they
will not be considered equal if they are different objects.

```tsx
const options1 = { glare: true, max: 25, 'max-glare': 0.5, speed: 400 }
const options2 = { glare: true, max: 25, 'max-glare': 0.5, speed: 400 }
Object.is(options1, options2) // false!!
```

So the easiest way to fix this is by switching from using an object to using the
primitive values directly. This way, the dependency array will only change when
the actual values change.

So please update the `useEffect` to use the primitive values directly. Thanks!
